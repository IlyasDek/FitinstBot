# FitinstBot
FitInstBot is a Telegram bot designed to create personalized workout and diet plans for users based on their individual data. The bot uses machine learning models to recommend exercises and diet plans tailored to the user's fitness goals, health restrictions, and personal attributes.

Note: Currently, work is in progress to form the necessary dataset for the project. This dataset will include user information and a comprehensive list of exercises to enable the machine learning model to provide accurate recommendations.
